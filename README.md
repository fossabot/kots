## CLI

### `kots install`
The `install` command is the recommended way to learn kots. Executing the `install` command will install an application and the [kotsadm](https://github.com/replicatedhq/kotsadm) Admin Console to an existing Kubernetes cluster. This command supports installing Helm charts (without Tiller), standard Kubernetes applications and also Replicated apps.

To try it, just choose a helm chart ([Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/tree/master/elasticsearch)) and run the following command:

```
kubectl kots install helm://elastic/elasticsearch --repo https://helm.elastic.co --namespace elasticsearch
```

After this command completes, the kotsadm Admin Console will be running in your cluster, listening on port :8800 on a ClusterIP service in the namespace you deployed the application to. You can connect to this using kubectl port-forward, or set up an ingress/load balancer of your own.

```
kubectl admin-console elasticsearchs
```

And now visit http://localhost:8800 to set the Elasticsearch Admin Console.


### `kots pull`
The `pull` command will create a local directory set up so you can create Kustomize-friendly patches and then use kubectl to deploy to a cluster yourself. The pull command will not add the admin console to a cluster or install anything in your cluster.

```
kubectl kots pull helm://elastic/elasticsearch --namespace elasticsearch
kubectl apply -k ./elasticsearch/overlays/midstream
```

### `kots upload`
The `upload` command will upload a directory with an upstream, base and overlays directory to a kotsdm server.

```
kubectl kots upload ~/elasticsearch
```

### `kots download`
The `download` command will download an application YAML from a kotsadm server. This is especially useful when paired with `upload` (above) to iterate on and make changes to an application.

```
kubectl kots download [--namespace] [app-slug]
```

The app-slug argument is optional. If there is more than 1 application in the specified namespace, kots will prompt for which one to download.
